6) a)Write a ruby code for Fibonacci Series
b)Take a input and check the value is “string” ,”float” or “integer” using case statement
7) Write a program for getting your name,age,mark1,mark2 and mark3(use if)

Display the result as
Name
Age

Mark 2
Mark 3
Total

8)
the_count = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;oranges&#39;, &#39;pears&#39;, &#39;apricots&#39;]
change = [1, &#39;pennies&#39;, 2, &#39;dimes&#39;, 3, &#39;quarters&#39;]

Expected output
This is count 1
This is count 2
This is count 3
This is count 4
This is count 5
A fruit of type: apples
